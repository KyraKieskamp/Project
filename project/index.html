      <h1>OBELIX study 2009-2013</h1>
        <p>
        OBELIX (OBesogenic Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs): LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of obesity
        later in life) is a multidisciplinary European research project that was performed from May 2009 to November 2013. The
        main goal of OBELIX was to investigate if early life exposure to EDCs (endocrine disrupting chemicals) plays a role in the development of obesity and
        related disorders later in life. OBELIX investigated six major classes of EDCs, including dioxins, polychlorinated
        biphenyls, brominated flame retardants, organochlorine pesticides, phthalates, and perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAAs). (Text obtained from OBELIX report summary).</p>

      <h3>Project Context and Objectives:</h3>
        <p>The incidence of childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally. Despite advancements in knowledge on
        the endocrine and neuronal regulation of energy balance, there is still much uncertainty related to the etiology and
        underlying physiological mechanisms of obesity. There is accumulating evidence that factors that influence long-term
        risk of obesity and related disorders begin very early in life. Early life exposure to environmental contaminants has
        been implicated in altering developmental metabolic programming, resulting in possible higher susceptibility to obesity.
        The OBELIX (OBesogenic Endocrine disrupting chemicals: LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of obesity later
        in life) project examines the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in food plays
        a role in the development of obesity later in life. (Text obtained from OBELIX report summary). </p>

      <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
      <div id = "risk_assessment">
      </div>
        <p>One of the main goals of OBELIX is to ascertain if there are risks for obesity or related metabolic disorders in children
        at current background levels of EDCs. To this end, the researchers performed risk assessment using the 5 EDCs that were tested in
        animal studies in WP5. Two of the OBELIX EDCs, namely DDE and BDE-47, were not included in this risk assessment
        exercise, as the researchers did not perform animal studies on these compounds in OBELIX. It should be mentioned for DDE,
        however, that a consistent set of observations was found in WP1 indicating that prenatal DDE is associated with
        accelerated growth in early childhood, and increased BMI and serum leptin levels at age 6 years (see explanation at "Effects"). This would suggest
        that current background levels of DDE are not without risk and further examination of health risks of DDE exposure in
        children is warranted. 
        For the risk assessment, we selected the most sensitive critical effect observed in OBELIX animal studies and
        compared this to benchmark dose levels (BMDL) established by EFSA. We then calculated a corresponding tolerable
        daily intake (TDI) level and compared this to exposure and/or body burden (BB) levels reported by EFSA, taking
        important exposure routes into account. Where possible we also used calculated food exposure data from WP3, in
        which food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) from FLEHS, Michalovce and LINC were used to calculate exposure to EDCs
        through the diet. (Text obtained from OBELIX report summary).</p>

      <h3>Effects of chemicals</h3>
      <div id = "chemicals_effect">
      </div>

      <h4>Mouse model effects</h4>
        <p>A total of 5 long term animal studies were carried out in OBELIX. The selected test EDCs were BPA, PFOA, TCDD, DEHP
        and PCB 153. Maternal exposure to the chemicals at low concentrations (generally below NOAEL for developmental
        toxicity) was given through the diet during pre-mating, gestation and lactation (total of 9 weeks). C57BL/6 (B6) dams
        were mated with FVB males, and after weaning, exposure was stopped, and the F1 progeny were maintained for a
        period of 20 to 55 weeks of age. (Text obtained from OBELIX report summary).</p>

      </div>
      <hr>

      <h4>Human model effects</h4>
        <p>Growth during early childhood and BMI at 6 years showed an relation with early life exposure to EDCs. Pooling cohorts
        gave a large sample size, allowing distinction between investigation of effects due to (modelled) prenatal and postnatal
        exposure to PCBs, DDE and HCB. Distinct effects were observed for the different chemicals depending on pre- or
        postnatal exposure. Our studies indicated that an increase in growth and BMI at 6 years was associated with prenatal
        DDE exposure. In contrast, a significant decrease in growth was associated with postnatal PCB-153 exposure (Iszatt et
        al, 2014, submitted). Preliminary studies also indicate a relation with perinatal exposure to dioxin-like compounds and
        BMI at 6 years (Iszatt et al, in preparation). (Text obtained from OBELIX report summary).</p>
