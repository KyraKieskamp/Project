#Project purpose
The purpose of this project is to show a general interactive overview of the OBELIX research. OBELIX was a 4-year running, 2009-2013, European-Commission funded research project with its goal to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to various endocrine disrupting chemicals on the development of obesity later in life (http://www.theobelixproject.org/). Endocrine disrupting chemicals are chemicals that can affect hormonal levels and their activity inside the body. The interactive visualization shows the following parts of the study: the final results of the risk assessment of the studied chemicals, the effects observed during the animal study, a comparison between exposure of chemicals and the effects (growth) in babies in the studied cohorts (groups of people), and an overview of various characteristics of those cohorts. For understanding this interactive visualization, some background in (environmental) toxicology and scientific research is advised.

# Directory naviagtion
Navigation through the project directory: index.html contains the final version of this project. The style.css contains all style script. All images used in the html page can be found in the images directory. All files used for data conversion are in the scripts directory. All javascript files are in javascript directory. All csv, tsv and json files are in the data directory. As d3 is used, it is added to the project directory as well. The prototype directory still contains 2 prototype html versions.
