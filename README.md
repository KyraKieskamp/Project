Project - Data Visualization of the OBELIX research


# Features exposed/problem solved
In my data visualization project I aim to create an interactive visualization of the OBELIX study. OBELIX was a 4-year running, 2009-2013, European-Commission funded research project with its goal to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to various endocrine disrupting chemicals on the development of obesity later in life (http://www.theobelixproject.org/). Endocrine disrupting chemicals are chemicals that can affect hormonal levels and their activity inside the body. The interactive visualization I aim to create will show both the general set-up of this academic study as well as the final results, including the risk assessment of the chemicals studied. By doing this, I hope to present an understandable overview of the OBELIX study for not only academics themselves, but mainly for the general public. 
The OBELIX project consists of various objectives, which I all aim to show in my visualization. The Minimum Viable Product however, will not contain all, but only a carefully selected part of the objectives. 
The objectives of the OBELIX study were assessing prenatal exposure in humans of the studied chemicals, using mother-child cohorts from various European regions. Performing hazard characterization of early life exposure to the studied chemicals with respect to obesity later in life, using mouse model analysis. Determining the mechanisms of action of the chemicals, so how they cause certain effects in humans. And performing a risk assessment of prenatal exposure to the studied chemicals (http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/153420_en.html). 
The features chosen to be represented in the interactive visualization is the risk assessment of the various chemicals (potentially in a graph), a map representing the locations of the mother-child cohorts used across Europe, various characteristics of the mother-child cohorts, the results of the mouse model analysis, linking early life exposure to potential developments in obesity later in life, and general information and environmental concentrations (for example in food) of the various researched chemicals. 
The Minimum Viable Product will contain the map representing the locations of the mother-child cohorts across Europe, and an interactively linked visualization of the characteristics of these cohorts. Additionally, an information overview will be presented of two chosen chemicals researched in OBELIX (persistent organist pollutants: PCB-153 and p,pâ€™-DDE), which will be interactively linked to graphs/bar charts showing the exposure, concentration in blood and the risk assessment of these two chosen chemicals for the mother-child cohorts. 
So, the goal of this project is to create a general and understandable interactive overview of the OBELIX research (or part of the research for the Minimum Viable Product) for the general public, solving the problem of necessarily having an academic background in the environmental/toxicological field in order to comprehend the OBELIX project.

# Data sets and data sources



# Platform facilitate creating the application
The platform to facilitate creating the application will be mainly javascript and D3. Additionally python will be used if the data sets need to be adapted for their proper integration in javascript and D3. A map of Europe in which the locations of the cohorts from the study are presented, will be integrated in the application using D3. Web-searched images of the chemicals researched in the OBELIX project will be represented in the application as well. Features in D3, like bar graphs and line graphs, will also be used for data representation of chemical concentrations and risk assessments.
