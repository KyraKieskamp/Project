After presentations, considerable design alterations:
- change the interactive map into an interactive table (the interactivity of the map does not provide much added value to the story telling, only 4-7 countries are namely presented)
- the interactivity will fall outside of the MVP
- part of the effects graphs will now be part of the MVP - this aids more to the storry telling and thus has higher priority

# day 6
Monday
Decision: use bootstrap for webpage (created a trail webpage in the trail directory)

# day 7
Tuesday
Adapted the data. 

# day 8
Wednesday
Decision: create a blue band around the chemical images, which pops up on hovering

# day 9
Thursday
Decision: necessary to make an extra feature for the blue band. They need to overlay. 

# day 10
Friday
Adaptations need to be made for the 3rd graph - the effect graph. Possibly an other bar graph, but that would be two bar graphs in the same visualization. 
Over the weekend, have the implementations of the chemicals and their images, together with the bar graph
For the interactive table a decision needs to be made to have a feature where you can select the variables the user wants to be shown in the table. The other, easier, option is to first have all the variables shown in the table, and then have them reordered when clicked on one of the features.
