After presentations, considerable design alterations:
- change the interactive map into an interactive table (the interactivity of the map does not provide much added value to the story telling, only 4-7 countries are namely presented)
- the interactivity will fall outside of the MVP
- part of the effects graphs will now be part of the MVP - this aids more to the storry telling and thus has higher priority
